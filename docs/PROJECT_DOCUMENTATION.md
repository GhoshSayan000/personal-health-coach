# Personal Health Coach – Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction

Personal Health Coach is an AI-powered wellness agent designed to provide supportive, ethical, and personalized health guidance. The project focuses on both **mental and physical well-being**, offering users a safe space to discuss their health concerns and lifestyle goals.

This system is **not a medical replacement**. Instead, it works as a preventive and awareness-focused companion that encourages healthier decisions and timely professional consultation.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Many people:

* Ignore early health symptoms
* Feel hesitant or uncomfortable discussing mental health
* Lack structured medical history records
* Want lifestyle improvement guidance without clinical pressure

Traditional health apps often feel cold, data-heavy, or overly clinical. This project aims to bridge that gap with a **human-like AI health coach**.

---

## 3. Project Objectives

The main objectives of the Personal Health Coach are:

* To provide empathetic and welcoming health conversations
* To assist users in understanding their physical and mental health
* To organize and summarize medical history efficiently
* To offer safe, non-diagnostic wellness recommendations
* To reduce unnecessary processing costs through data compression

---

## 4. System Overview

The system functions as an **AI Agent** that interacts conversationally with users. It processes user-provided information such as:

* Symptoms
* Lifestyle habits
* Emotional state
* Medical history (if available)

Based on this, it generates wellness guidance while maintaining ethical boundaries.

## 5. Agent Interaction Design

### 5.1 Communication Style

* Warm, polite, and supportive tone
* Non-judgmental responses
* Simple and clear language
* Emotion-aware conversation flow

### 5.2 Trust & Safety Principles

* Encourages honesty without pressure
* Respects user privacy
* Avoids alarming or absolute statements
* Promotes professional help when required

## 6. Medical History Management

### 6.1 Existing Medical History

If a user already has medical records:

* The agent uses them as contextual input
* Data is summarized into actionable insights
* No assumptions are made beyond provided evidence

### 6.2 Medical History Maker

If no prior history exists, the system provides a **Medical History Maker**:

* Conversational data collection
* Gradual questioning
* Option to provide valid medical documents
* Cross-verification mindset similar to real doctors

This improves accuracy and reduces misinformation.

All outputs are:

* Explainable
