## 🧾 Medical History Handling

### Existing Medical History

If a user already has documented medical history:

#### Medical History Maker (Special Feature)

If a user does not have an existing medical history, the system provides a Medical History Maker, which helps build a health profile through:
Natural, conversational questions asked gradually and respectfully

The option to upload or reference valid medical documents as supporting evidence

A verification-inspired flow similar to real-world medical consultations

This feature improves data reliability and avoids assumptions based solely on self-reporting.
