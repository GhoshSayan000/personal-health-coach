📌 Overview

Personal Health Coach is an AI-powered wellness agent designed to support users through their health journey with warmth, empathy, and understanding. Personal Health Coach is an AI-powered wellness companion designed to help you better understand and enhance your everyday health habits. 

It focuses on what matters most: preventive care and sustainable lifestyle improvements.

The system focuses on both mental and physical well-being by analyzing medical history and wellness data to deliver personalized health and lifestyle recommendations in an efficient and accessible way.

This project is not designed to replace doctors. Instead, it acts as a preventive and supportive health companion, helping users better understand their body and mind while guiding them toward professional medical help when necessary.

🎯 Project Goals

Our mission is to create a wellness experience that feels genuinely supportive and human. The project aims to:

Provide warm and welcoming interactions for users seeking health guidance

Support mental health awareness alongside physical wellness

Transform complex medical history and wellness data into clear, actionable insights

Generate personalized recommendations that respect individual health journeys

Encourage timely consultation with healthcare professionals when required

Operate efficiently without heavy computational requirements

🤖 Agent Behavior & Interaction Design

The AI agent is designed to feel like a caring health coach, not a cold clinical system.
Every interaction is built on trust, understanding, and emotional safety.

Key Interaction Principles

Warm greetings and supportive tone throughout conversations

Non-judgmental communication to create a safe space for honesty

Awareness that users may hide discomfort or emotional distress

Clear communication without confusing medical jargon

Safety-first recommendations that prioritize user well-being

🧾 Medical History Handling
Existing Medical History

If a user already has documented medical history:

The agent uses this data as contextual input

Information is summarized and compressed efficiently

Recommendations are personalized based on health background

Medical History Maker (Special Feature)

If a user does not have an existing medical history, the system provides a Medical History Maker, which helps build a health profile through:

Natural, conversational questions asked gradually and respectfully

The option to upload or reference valid medical documents as supporting evidence

A verification-inspired flow similar to real-world medical consultations

This feature improves data reliability and avoids assumptions based solely on self-reporting.
